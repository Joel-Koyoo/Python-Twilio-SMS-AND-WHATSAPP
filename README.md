# PLANT INFORMATION SYSTEM

## About Projects

The above application was built on top twilio whatsapp and SMS service for communcation and message sending services

##About Application

Agriculture is at the backbone of most third world economies and information about the plants we are able to grow are not well disseminated.
Based on the research a higher majority of farms are found in the rural areas in which most do not have access to smartphones so as to be able to receive
the information.


##Proposed Solve

The application aims at creating an on the go SMS service to be able to receive information about a variety of plant the user
would be interested in and a guided track in which they would follow based on the plant chosen
furthermore the user would be able to subscribe to a service for them to be reminded on activities such as when to perform weeding in some grains as well as
any weather change.
